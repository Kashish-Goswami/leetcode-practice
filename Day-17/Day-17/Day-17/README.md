# Day 17 – Advanced Graphs

## ✅ Problems Solved
1. Number of Provinces (Union-Find)
2. Redundant Connection (Union-Find)
3. Network Delay Time (Dijkstra)
4. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops (BFS + Relaxation)

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)
- Path compression
- Dijkstra’s shortest path
- BFS with constraints

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time: O(E log V), O(E × K)
- Space: O(V + E)

## 📌 Learnings
- Union-Find simplifies connectivity problems
- Dijkstra handles weighted shortest paths
- BFS can be adapted with constraints
