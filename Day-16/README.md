# Day 16 – Dynamic Programming (Advanced)

## ✅ Problems Solved
1. Unique Paths (Medium)
2. Longest Common Subsequence (Medium)
3. Subset Sum – 0/1 Knapsack (Medium)
4. Edit Distance (Hard)

## 💡 Concepts Used
- 2D Dynamic Programming
- String DP
- Knapsack pattern
- State transition & base cases

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(m × n)
- Space Complexity: O(m × n)

## 📌 Learnings
- Proper state definition is key in DP
- Many problems reduce to table-filling
- Hard DP problems require careful transitions
