# Day 08 – Binary Search (Medium / Hard)

## ✅ Problems Solved
1. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)
2. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)
3. Koko Eating Bananas (Medium)
4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard)

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Binary search on rotated arrays
- Binary search on answer
- Partition-based binary search

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log n), O(n log m)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 📌 Learnings
- Binary search is not limited to sorted arrays
- Many optimization problems use binary search on answer
- Hard problems require careful boundary handling
