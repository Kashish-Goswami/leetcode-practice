# Day 14 – Dynamic Programming (Core)

## ✅ Problems Solved
1. Climbing Stairs (Easy)
2. House Robber (Medium)
3. Coin Change (Medium)
4. Longest Increasing Subsequence (Medium)

## 💡 Concepts Used
- 1D Dynamic Programming
- State transition
- Space optimization
- Bottom-up approach

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time: O(n), O(n²), O(n × amount)
- Space: O(1), O(n)

## 📌 Learnings
- DP breaks problems into overlapping subproblems
- Space can often be optimized
- Clear state definition is key to DP
