# Day 12 – Trees (DFS / BFS)

## ✅ Problems Solved
1. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (Easy)
2. Invert Binary Tree (Easy)
3. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (Medium)
4. Diameter of Binary Tree (Easy / Medium)

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Recursion
- Queue based traversal

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(h) / O(n)

## 📌 Learnings
- DFS is useful for height and depth problems
- BFS helps process tree level by level
- Global variables help track state during recursion
