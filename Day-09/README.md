# Day 09 – Linked List Problems

## ✅ Problems Solved
1. Reverse Linked List (Easy)
2. Linked List Cycle (Easy)
3. Remove Nth Node From End of List (Medium)
4. Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Pointer manipulation
- Two pointer technique
- Dummy node usage
- Cycle detection (Floyd’s algorithm)

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 📌 Learnings
- Linked lists require careful pointer handling
- Dummy nodes simplify edge cases
- Two pointers are powerful for traversal problems
